&#8202;<span class="project-name">Elsewhere</span> is a [Node.js][node] project that aims to replicate part of the functionality of the Google's now discontinued [Social Graph API][google-social-graph-api]. When given the URL of a person's website or social media profile (e.g. a [Twitter account][twitter-profile]), it outputs a JSON-formatted list of the other websites and social media profiles that belong to that person. In other words, it can determine a person's ['social graph'][socialgraph] from a single URL in the graph.

Elsewhere can be set up as a web service, providing a JSON API that can be easily queried over a network. It can also be included as a Node module and used directly within a server-side project.
