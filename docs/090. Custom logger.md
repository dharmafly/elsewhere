Elsewhere uses a simple logging system that writes to Node's console. You can replace the logger with your own, for example, to store warnings and errors in a database or log file. To add your own custom logger, all you need to do is provide an object with the following interface:

  	{
      info:  function (message) { /* code to pass on message */ },
      log:   function (message) { /* code to pass on message */ },
      warn:  function (message) { /* code to pass on message */ },
      error: function (message) { /* code to pass on message */ }
    }

You must then add this object to the `logger` property of the options object passed into the `graph()` method.
