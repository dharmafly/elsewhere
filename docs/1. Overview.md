&#8291;<span class="project-name">{{ site.PROJECT_NAME }}</span> is a Node.js project that aims to replicate the functionality of the Google Social Graph API.

It does this by crawling a target url for `rel=me` [microformated][microformats] links. It then crawls those links for more `rel=me` links and so on, building a comprehensive graph as it goes.

Elsewhere provides a JSON API that URL's can be easily queried against over a network. It can also be included as a [Node.js][node] module and used directly in your server projects.
